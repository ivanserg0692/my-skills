# Domain-Driven Design (Symfony)

## Building blocks

| Tactical pattern | In Symfony/PHP |
|---|---|
| Aggregate root | Entity class that guards invariants and is the only entry point to its cluster |
| Entity | Has identity (`OrderId`), mutable over its lifecycle |
| Value object | `final readonly class`, no identity, compared by value (`Money`, `Email`) |
| Domain event | `final readonly class` recorded on the aggregate and published according to an explicit transaction policy |
| Repository | Interface in the domain, Doctrine adapter in infrastructure (see `hexagonal-architecture`) |
| Domain service | Stateless logic that doesn't belong to a single aggregate |

## Value objects

Immutable, self-validating, compared by value. Replace primitive obsession.

```php
// ✅ GOOD — value object enforces its own invariants
final readonly class Email
{
    public function __construct(public string $value)
    {
        if (!filter_var($value, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)) {
            throw new \InvalidArgumentException("Invalid email: {$value}");
        }
    }

    public function equals(self $other): bool
    {
        return $this->value === $other->value;
    }
}

final readonly class Money
{
    public function __construct(public int $amountInCents, public Currency $currency) {}

    public function add(self $other): self
    {
        if ($this->currency !== $other->currency) {
            throw new \DomainException('Currency mismatch');
        }
        return new self($this->amountInCents + $other->amountInCents, $this->currency);
    }
}

// ❌ BAD — primitives everywhere, no invariants, validation scattered across services
function createOrder(string $email, int $totalCents): void { /* ... */ }
```

Map value objects with Doctrine **embeddables** (`#[ORM\Embedded]`) or a **custom DBAL type**, so the table stays flat while the model stays rich.

## Aggregates protect invariants

- The aggregate root is the **only** object outside code may hold a reference to.
- Mutations go through **behavior methods** on the root, never setters.
- Invariants are checked inside those methods — an aggregate can never be in an invalid state.
- Keep aggregates **small**; reference other aggregates by **ID**, not object reference.

```php
// ✅ GOOD — behavior methods guard invariants; children reached only through the root
#[ORM\Entity]
class Order
{
    #[ORM\Id, ORM\Column(type: 'uuid')]
    private Uuid $id;

    #[ORM\Column(enumType: OrderStatus::class)]
    private OrderStatus $status;

    /** @var Collection<int, OrderLine> */
    #[ORM\OneToMany(targetEntity: OrderLine::class, mappedBy: 'order', cascade: ['persist'], orphanRemoval: true)]
    private Collection $lines;

    /** @var DomainEvent[] */
    private array $recordedEvents = [];

    private function __construct(Uuid $id)
    {
        $this->id = $id;
        $this->status = OrderStatus::Pending;
        $this->lines = new ArrayCollection();
    }

    public static function place(): self
    {
        $order = new self(Uuid::v7());
        $order->record(new OrderPlaced($order->id));
        return $order;
    }

    public function addLine(Uuid $productId, int $quantity): void
    {
        if ($this->status !== OrderStatus::Pending) {
            throw new \DomainException('Cannot modify a confirmed order'); // invariant
        }
        $this->lines->add(new OrderLine($this, $productId, $quantity));
    }

    public function confirm(): void
    {
        if ($this->lines->isEmpty()) {
            throw new \DomainException('Cannot confirm an empty order'); // invariant
        }
        $this->status = OrderStatus::Confirmed;
        $this->record(new OrderConfirmed($this->id));
    }

    /** @return DomainEvent[] */
    public function releaseEvents(): array
    {
        $events = $this->recordedEvents;
        $this->recordedEvents = [];
        return $events;
    }

    private function record(DomainEvent $event): void
    {
        $this->recordedEvents[] = $event;
    }
}

// ❌ BAD — anemic entity: public setters let any caller break invariants
class Order
{
    public OrderStatus $status;
    public Collection $lines;
    public function setStatus(OrderStatus $s): void { $this->status = $s; }
}
```

## Domain events

Record events inside the aggregate, but choose their handling and publication timing explicitly.

- `flush()` synchronizes Doctrine state with the database; it is not a universal transaction-commit boundary.
- Doctrine `postFlush` runs after the flush lifecycle, but an explicitly managed outer transaction may still be open. Do not describe `postFlush` as a guaranteed after-commit hook.
- Calling Symfony Messenger's `dispatch()` does not by itself prove that the database transaction has committed; the effective timing depends on the transport and middleware configuration.
- In-process domain-event handlers may run inside an application transaction when their failure is intended to fail that transaction.
- When an external message must be published only for committed state and survive process or broker failures, persist an outbox record in the same database transaction as the aggregate. Publish it asynchronously after commit, then mark it as delivered with an idempotent strategy.

```php
// ✅ Persist integration messages atomically with aggregate changes.
$entityManager->wrapInTransaction(function () use ($entityManager, $order): void {
    $entityManager->persist($order);

    foreach ($order->releaseEvents() as $event) {
        $entityManager->persist(OutboxMessage::fromDomainEvent($event));
    }
});

// A separate worker publishes committed outbox records through Messenger.
```

## Ubiquitous language

- Name classes and methods with the **business** vocabulary: `Order::confirm()`, not `Order::setStatusToConfirmed()`.
- The same term means the same thing in code, tests, and conversation.
- Bounded contexts get their own namespace (`App\Sales\…`, `App\Billing\…`); the same word may differ between them.

## Gotchas

- Agent generates anemic entities with public setters — model behavior methods that enforce invariants.
- Agent uses primitive `string`/`int` for `Email`, `Money`, `OrderId` — introduce value objects.
- Agent references other aggregates by object (`#[ORM\ManyToOne] private Customer $customer`) — reference by ID across aggregate boundaries.
- Agent treats `postFlush` as guaranteed after-commit delivery — define the transaction policy explicitly and use an outbox for reliable external publication.
- Agent puts cross-aggregate logic on an entity — use a stateless domain service.
- Agent makes huge aggregates loading dozens of children — keep them small; consider a separate read model.
- Agent names methods after database operations (`save`, `update`) instead of intent (`confirm`, `cancel`).
